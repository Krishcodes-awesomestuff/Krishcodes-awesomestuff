Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> <br> 

I’m <a href='https://krishnaprasath.vercel.app/'> Krishnaprasath, a front-end web developer and UI/UX designer from India.

I love crafting sleek, responsive, and intuitive user interfaces that help products stand out.

Outside of VS Code and Figma, you’ll find me at hackathons, talking about tech non-stop, or exploring new design trends. I’m also passionate about mentoring peers and building side projects that solve real-world problems.

Fun-fact:
1) While building a website, I deleted the entire folder over 10 times because I couldn't achieve the design or animation I wanted, so I kept redoing it from scratch.
2) I talk about tech a lot, so much that it practically makes me a certified <s> developer </s> yapper.
