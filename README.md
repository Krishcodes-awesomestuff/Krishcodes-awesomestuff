Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> <br>
I’m Krishnaprasath, a front-end web developer and UI/UX designer from India.

I love crafting sleek, responsive, and intuitive user interfaces that help products stand out.

Outside of VS Code and Figma, you’ll find me at hackathons, talking about tech non-stop, or exploring new design trends. I’m also passionate about mentoring peers and building side projects that solve real-world problems.
